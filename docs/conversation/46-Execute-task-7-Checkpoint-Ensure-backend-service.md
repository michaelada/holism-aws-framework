**Assistant:**

I'll help you run the checkpoint to ensure all backend services tests pass. Let me start by updating the task status and then running the test suite.

Now let me run the backend test suite to check if all tests pass:

Let me run the tests without the --run flag since this is Jest, not Vitest:

Perfect! All backend tests are passing. The test suite ran successfully with:
- 28 test suites passed
- 315 tests passed
- All Keycloak admin integration tests (unit and property-based) passed

Now let me mark the checkpoint task as complete:

Excellent! The checkpoint is complete. All backend services tests are passing successfully:

**Test Results Summary:**
- ✅ 28 test suites passed
- ✅ 315 tests passed
- ✅ All Keycloak Admin Service tests passed (unit + property-based)
- ✅ All Tenant Service tests passed (unit + property-based)
- ✅ All User Service tests passed (unit + property-based)
- ✅ All Role Service tests passed (unit + property-based)

The backend implementation for tasks 1-6 is solid and all correctness properties are validated. You're ready to move forward with the next tasks in the implementation plan (starting with task 8: Audit Logging Service).
