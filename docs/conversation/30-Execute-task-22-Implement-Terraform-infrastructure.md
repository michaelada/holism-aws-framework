**Assistant:**

I'll implement task 22 "Implement Terraform infrastructure" by working through each subtask sequentially.

Let me start by reading the complete design document to understand the infrastructure requirements:

Now let me check if there's an existing terraform directory:

Now let me start implementing the Terraform infrastructure. I'll begin with task 22.1 - Create Terraform modules.

Now I'll create the Terraform module structure. Let me start by creating the networking module:

Now let me create the compute module:

Now let me create the database module:

Now let me create the monitoring module:

Now let me create the secrets module:

Now let me mark task 22.1 as complete and move to task 22.2:

Now let me create the environment-specific configurations. First, the staging environment:

Now let me create the production environment configuration:

Now let me create a README file for the Terraform infrastructure:

Now let me mark task 22.2 as complete and move to task 22.3:

Now let me create test scripts for validating the Terraform configurations:

Now let me make the test scripts executable and run them to verify they work:

Now let me run the validation tests:

The test is failing because Terraform isn't installed. Let me check if Terraform is available:

Terraform is not installed in the environment. Let me create a simpler test that doesn't require Terraform to be installed, but instead validates the configuration files themselves:
