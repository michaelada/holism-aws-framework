**Assistant:**

I'll implement task 11, which is a checkpoint to ensure all backend API tests pass. Let me start by updating the task status and then running the tests.

Now let me run all the backend tests to see their current status:

Let me run the tests without the --run flag since this is Jest, not Vitest:

Perfect! All backend tests are passing. The test suite shows:
- **34 test suites passed**
- **426 tests passed**
- All Keycloak admin integration tests are passing
- All property-based tests are passing
- All unit tests are passing

Now let me mark this checkpoint task as complete:

Excellent! Task 11 checkpoint is complete. All backend API tests are passing successfully:

✅ **Test Results Summary:**
- 34 test suites passed
- 426 tests passed
- All Keycloak admin integration tests passing
- All property-based tests passing (including token refresh, authentication retry, tenant/user/role management, audit logging, and error handling)
- All unit tests passing

The backend implementation is solid and ready for the next phase. All the services, routes, error handling, and audit logging are working correctly according to the tests.
