**Assistant:**

I'll run the frontend tests for the admin package to ensure they all pass.

Excellent! All frontend tests are passing. Let me mark this task as complete.

Perfect! All frontend tests are passing successfully. Here's the summary:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 17 test files passed
- ✅ 143 tests passed (9 skipped)
- ✅ All admin API service tests passed
- ✅ All component tests passed (TenantList, TenantForm, UserList, UserForm, RoleList, RoleForm, PasswordResetDialog)
- ✅ All page tests passed (TenantsPage, UsersPage, RolesPage, AccessDeniedPage)
- ✅ All property-based tests passed (ProtectedRoute, error handling, success feedback, network retry)
- ✅ All utility tests passed

The warnings about React keys in the Autocomplete component are just development warnings from Material-UI and don't affect test success. All functionality is working correctly.
