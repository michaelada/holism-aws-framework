Refresh plan

**Assistant:**

I'll analyze the requirements, design documents, and current codebase to refresh the task list. Let me start by reading the complete tasks.md file and exploring the current implementation status.

Let me read the rest of the tasks.md file:

Now let me explore the current codebase to understand what has been implemented:

Now let me check if there are any components or pages already created:

Let me check what's in the App.tsx:

Now let me check if there are any other packages created (orgadmin-core, orgadmin-events, etc.):

Let me check the backend to see if any orgadmin services exist:

Let me check what services currently exist in the backend:

Let me check the design document to see what's been completed:

Now let me check the test files to see what's been tested:

Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding. Let me update the tasks.md file to reflect the current state:

No problem! Since you hit the update button by mistake and don't need me to check the tasks, I'll stop here. 

Just to confirm - you don't want me to refresh/update the tasks.md file based on the current codebase state? I was in the middle of analyzing what's been completed (Phase 1 tasks 1.1-1.6 appear done) versus what still needs to be implemented.

Let me know if you'd like me to:
1. Continue with the task refresh analysis
2. Do something else entirely
3. Just wait for your next instruction
